## Installation and Running

### Cloning:

```console
git clone https://github.com/jlofti/Chip8Emulator.git
git submodule init
cd Chip8Emulator
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

_Note: be sure SDL2 is installed!_

### Build and Run:

```console
cd Chip8Emulator
cd build
make -j4
./Chip8Emulator -ROM {path} -FPS {FPS}
```

Command line inputs are only partially validated so don't go too crazy ðŸ˜¬. Place your roms in the rom folder. I think 540 is accurate for FPS

### Example:

```console
/Chip8Emulator -ROM pong.ch8 -FPS 540




```
